                    <p>Firefile Sorcery School is an online text adventure game written in Python.</p>
            
                    <p>Your goal is to explore the world around you, solve puzzles, fight monsters, 
                    complete quests, and eventually become a Sorcerer capable of changing and 
                    adding to the very fabric of the world itself.</p>
            
                    <p>You play the game by typing commands into the console. Useful commands include
                    'look' to examine your surroundings or an object, 'take' to pick something up, 
                    'inventory' to see what you are carrying, and 'go' to move a particular 
                    direction.  You can use prepositions to create more complex commands and 
                    adjectives to specify particular objects; articles are optional. Here are some
                    examples of valid commands:</p>
                    
                    <el>
                        <li>'look'</li>
                        <li>'go north'</li>
                        <li>'examine mirror'</li> 
                        <li>'take sword'</li>
                        <li>'take the rusty sword'</li>
                        <li>'wield sword'</li>
                        <li>'wear chainmail'</li>
                        <li>'attack orc'</li>
                        <li>'drink potion from tall flask'</li>
                        <li>'put the gold coin in the leather bag'</li>
                        <li>'drop three copper coins, two torches and the knapsack'</li>
                    </el>
            
                    <p>You can create shortcuts to reduce typing; type 'alias' for more details. 
                    Type 'quit' to save your progress and leave the game.</p>
